Plenty of restaurants around and overall a safe neighborhood. Didn't have a problem walking late at night. Only thing is the construction that is going on across the street, which will probably wake you up early, but that wasn't a big deal. Easy communication with Katia and Margasaret, who checked us in and showed us around the condo. Overall, I would recommend the place and would stay here again."
